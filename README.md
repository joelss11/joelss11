### Hi there 👋


**joelss11/joelss11** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I am currently working on a project for an Olympic village which will be in charge of taking control and streamlining the way in which users interact with the             different courts or fields that exist within said Olympic village
- 🌱 I am currently learning and consolidating new technologies such as typescript, java, spring boot and microservices
- 💬 Ask me about javascript, react & redux
- 📫 How to reach me: joelss084@gmail.com
