Full Stack Developer from Monteria-Cordoba, Colombia

I am a person who is passionate about technology, I like to embark on challenges that demand a lot from me since I am a person who asks more of myself every day to be better in the things I do.
I like to be aware of the new technologies that come out at all times to put them into practice.


- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a project for an Olympic village which will be in charge of taking control and streamlining the way in which users interact with the             different courts or fields that exist within said Olympic village
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning and consolidating new technologies such as typescript, java, spring boot and microservices
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about javascript, react & redux
